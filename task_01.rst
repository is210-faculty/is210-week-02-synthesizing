Why I Love Python
##################

Why I love **Python**, a language worth knowing. 

***********
Running It
***********

Python syntax is really quite simple to execute. Anyone can do it just be
executing the python command on the command line and invoking the interpreter.

You can also execute python programs by calling the program filename such as:
..code:: python
print 'me@mymachine $ python my_file_name.py'

************
The Syntax
************

Python syntax is very easy to write. Take a look at this simple statement:

..code:: python
print 'Hello!'

=================================

************
The People
************

It's amazing how nice people are in the Python development world. Just as with
my community, however, it's important to follow certain rules of decorum.

- Be courteous to others.
- Always read the manual before asking questions.
- Be succint in your questions.
  - Don't give unnecessary details if they aren't needed.
  - Don't start a question with an apology or an annoucement that you're going
to ask the question.
  - Just ask the question.
==================================


***********
The Tools
***********

Python has a ton of excellent tools available for use.

A fantastic documentation generator that inteprets reStructuredText and turns
it into rich documents.

Web Frameworks
==============

Python has many great web frameworks, only a few of which will be listed here.
